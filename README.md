# Hono - Getting Started

This simple repo contains just some boilerplate code. Essentially this is me
just playing around with [Hono](https://hono.dev/) in preparation for creating a
more robust template for scaffolding off of.

To install dependencies:

```sh
bun install
```

To run:

```sh
bun dev
```

To run tests:

```sh
bun run test
```

open http://localhost:3000

**TODO:**

- [ ] Establish cleaner file structure.
- [ ] Incorporate Drizzle ORM with both SQLite and PostgreSQL.
